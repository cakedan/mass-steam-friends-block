# mass-steam-friends-block
Mass block/unblock steam friends so you can play Destiny 2 without crashing.


## Usage

There's an issue currently that crashes Destiny 2 if you have more than 300 steam friends (that are unblocked).
You can get around this issue by mass-blocking some friends during your play session, then unblocking them after you're finished.
Unblocking them while playing will crash the game (since you'll have more than 300 steam friends).


1. Go to https://steamcommunity.com/my/friends/all
2. Select Manage Friends List
3. Go to your internet browser's console (usually ctrl + shift + j)
3. Copy the script you'd like to use (and modify the status/timestamps)
4. Paste it into your console and press enter
5. Select Block/Unblock

(Status types are `all`, `offline`, `online`, `playing`)
(only `offline` supports maxDays, maxHours, maxMinutes)
